# Cleanup

- [ ] CHECK UPPER CASE IN ENUMS
- [ ] ENUMS NAMING, are they needed?
- [ ] #define BUFFER_COUNT BUFFER_LAST, AS STANDARD?
- [ ] Remove all sprintf
- [ ] Different precisions bases instead of one big in sensorsfeed
- [ ] FP8/FP16 weights need better placement, and should be macros
- [ ] Roll concats in utils?
- [x] Comments in sensorsfeed utils
